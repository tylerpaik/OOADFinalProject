Colony Manager

Manage a colony of people on a new planet. Similar to Oregon Trail, decisions are given at certain points which may spell disaster for your colony.
PlanetColonyGame.Java is where main is held. Errors keep it from compiling in full, but if you proceed it will run till completion of what we currently have, which is mostly the setup of the colony, ironing out the methods by which our different systems interract, etc. Currently, the GUI is disconnected from the rest of the game, as there's no real "game" yet.

An external JAR library is used for colonist name generation https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker. All else is standard.
